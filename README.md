What is it?
===========

VTKToOSG is a simple project to demonstrates the usage of [vtkActorToOSG
class](http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/vtkActorToPF/) created by
Michael Gronager.

Dependencies
============

* VTK 5.8
* Boost 1.48
* Python 2.7.3
* OpenSceneGraph 3.0.1
* CMake 2.8.7

Probably it will also work with a bit older versions of these components. I did
not have an opportunity to test it, though.

Usage
=====

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cmake ../src`
3. `make`
